Over the last two days I have been fighting with getting a physical Button to work for my [Robot project](https://github.com/angelalonso/robot).  

I ended up doing the most counterintuitive form of button: a full-blown, wooden construction around a photo-interrupter.

I want to remember why I did that in three months, and probably a lot of other stuff that I normally put on READMEs, making those unreadable.

... and so I put together this blog.
