title: Robot - What happens when you don't do the math
---

So I had this problem: the robot doesn't move straight.  
I doesn't matter if I put more power ot one of the motors or the other, it slides to one side or ther, just a bit, sort of randomly.

The reason? the chassis for the robot includes a third wheel that also rotates on the vertical axis to follow movement produce by the two motors.

The position the wheel starts from affects where the robot goes when it moves forward or backward.

So I thought of putting two wheels that only rotate as they should, and get rid of that random wheel it has. The donor was a suitcase's wheelbase that I found...somewhere.

Put together some support with wire, mounted it and... robot goes straight!

Yeaaaaahwait! how about when the robot wants to rotate? Bummer, the robot doesn't rotate because the rubber they have don't go well with slipping sideways.

And that is a good example of why engineering is so much more than having ideas that "might work".
