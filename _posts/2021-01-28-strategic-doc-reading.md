title: Strategic Doc Reading
---
Ever since I read [this Post](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs) I have been wanting to put that technique to good use.

With a bit of self-reflection, I believe I am the perfect candidate to test it because:
- That technique seemed like the typical one that doesn't work for regular people
- I am pretty proud of my will power, and this would put it to a test
- I tend to forget stuff that I learnt months ago, and it frustrates me a lot

So... here is my first list (and the reading time needed for each topic):
- [AWS VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)
  - [How it works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html) - 12 mins
- [AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)
  - [Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html) - 23 mins for MySQL and PostgreSQL
- [AWS EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html)
- [K8S](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
  - [Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) - 9 minutes

I will continue adding details as I progress, but mostly these are the premises for this system to work (in order of importance):
- Do it regularly (starting with once a week, 1.5hrs.)
- Read the same docs again and again
- Balance between having too many docs to read and reading relevant docs. Expect constant corrections to the list because of this.
