title: Robot - When Angel met R:::OS
---

Google Now is a privacy nightmare but it sometimes proposes interesting things to read.

Last jackpot it hit was an article about how to use Unity to test ROS (or is it R:::OS ?) robots. 

After reading through it and https://www.ros.org I came to the obvious conclussion that ROS is a much better (software) project than this.

Still, there are some reasons why I will not abandon my Robot project so soon:  
- I started building the robot for the sake of learning how things fitted together. It only became something I'd want reproduceable later.
- The scope is somehow different: I am not aiming at creating standards that work for everyone.
- I am pretty sure that, given enough time, my Robot will get more and more compatible with ROS in things like setup files.
