title: Robot - When Angel met with the hard truth
---

Two days ago I (think I) bricked my arduino.  

This is much harder than just burning something due to an obvious mistake because it leaves you stranded, without any hints on whether a cable got loose, your software is doing something wrong...or you need to buy a new Arduino board.

Some months ago the same happened to the Raspberry pi I was using. 

And both issues together made me mad, and then sad. It means I am doing something wrong.

I first tried to find a simulator to build my circuits on, that might be able to tell me what I am doing wrong. But there is no simulator that would just replicate the full thing.

Then it hit me: I have no clue about electronics. I haven't been careful at all on what I put together other than "does it work?", and that might mean I am leaving a big amount of Amperes somewhere.

So I decided to go back to the basics: 

Raspberry communicates with Arduino, and I measure what happens on each connection.

...this sets me back for like three months or more and I just thought I was close to v2 u_u
